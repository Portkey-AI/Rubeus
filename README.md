1. Rubeus, much like Axios, provides a unified API signature to interact with multiple Language Learning Model (LLM) providers. With support for __ models across __ providers, Rubeus ensures you're not tied to any single provider and allows you to utilize the strengths of all. The real power of Rubeus lies in its advanced request modes - it's not just about sending requests, it's about sending them smartly.

2. Rubeus is like Axios, but for Large Language Models (LLMs). It's a powerful tool that provides a unified API to interact with multiple LLM providers, enabling you to tap into the unique strengths of each. Rubeus is more than a simple request-sending tool - it's a smart assistant that manages retries, fallbacks, and load distribution. With Rubeus, you're not just sending requests, you're doing it intelligently.

3. Think of Rubeus as Axios's big, friendly, magical cousin for Large Language Models (LLMs). Not only does Rubeus provide a unified API to interact with multiple LLM providers, but it also enables you to harness the unique strengths of each, just like our friend Axios. But Rubeus isn't simply about sending requests; oh no! With its advanced request modes, Rubeus transforms into a 'giant' smart assistant üé©, managing retries, fallbacks, and load distribution. Essentially, with Rubeus, you're not just sending requests - you're casting spells to communicate with language models intelligently! üöÄ

4. Welcome to Rubeus, your Axios for Large Language Models (LLMs). Rubeus is more than just a unified API for multiple LLM providers‚Äîit's your smart sidekick for sending requests. With its advanced modes, Rubeus manages retries, fallbacks, and load distribution, ensuring your interactions with language models are efficient and seamless. With Rubeus, you're not just sending requests, you're doing it like magic! üé©üöÄ

5. Just as Axios simplifies HTTP requests with its promise-based structure, Rubeus is your go-to tool for streamlining interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). Catering to a range of LLM providers, Rubeus extends beyond a unified API, becoming a powerful ally that expertly handles retries, fallbacks, and load distribution. The essence of Rubeus isn't merely about initiating requests‚Äîit's about ensuring these requests are handled intelligently and efficiently. With Rubeus, you're harnessing the power of language models, Axios-style! üíºüöÄ

## Key Features

- :globe_with_meridians: **Interoperability:** Write once, run with any provider. Switch between __ models from __ providers seamlessly.
- :arrows_counterclockwise: **Fallback Strategies:** Don't let failures stop you. If one provider fails, Rubeus automatically switches to another.
- :recycle: **Retry Strategies:** Temporary issues shouldn't mean manual re-runs. Rubeus automatically retries failed requests.
- :balance_scale: **Load Balancing:** Distribute load effectively across multiple API keys or providers based on custom weights.
- :memo: **Unified API Signature:** If you've used OpenAI, you already know how to use Rubeus.

## Supported Providers

We currently support several top language model providers, with more to come. The table below provides an overview of our supported and upcoming providers:

| Provider  | Support Status  | Description |

| ![LocalAI](logo_link) LocalAI  | :soon: Coming Soon  | LocalAI focuses on enabling local language understanding with their models. |
| Others  | :soon: Coming Soon  | We are constantly expanding to include more providers. |

Stay tuned for more updates on our supported providers.

## Installation
On the local machine,
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Or on the server, something like this
```
npm run deploy
```

## Usage

### Interoperability
Rubeus allows you to switch between different language learning models from various providers, making it a highly flexible tool.
```javascript
// example code
```

### Fallback Strategies
In case one provider fails, Rubeus is designed to automatically switch to another, ensuring uninterrupted service.
```javascript
// example code
```

### Retry Strategies
Rubeus has a built-in mechanism to retry failed requests, eliminating the need for manual re-runs.
```javascript
// example code
```

### Load Balancing
Manage your workload effectively with Rubeus's custom weight-based distribution across multiple API keys or providers.
```javascript
// example code
```

### Unified API Signature
If you're familiar with OpenAI's API, you'll find Rubeus's API easy to use due to its unified signature.
```javascript
// example code
```
